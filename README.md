# Doodler
A simple drawing app for Android.

# How to run program:
Run the app on your device by clicking the "Run" button in Android Studio or clicking on the app icon. After the app launches, you will 
see all the drawing options in the top action bar of the app. The first icon (from the left) in the action bar is the paint brush, 
which opens up a dialog that allows the user to select brush size and opacity. The second icon in the action bar is the color pallete, 
which opens up a dialog that allows the user to select a color for the brush. The third and fourth icons are the undo and redo icons, 
respectively. The fifth icon allows the user to clear the entire canvas (WARNING: Once cleared, the drawing cannot be retrieved again!). 
By default, the color of the brush is red and it is at full opacity.
